[b]Guidelines[/b]

[list]
[*] A mod which refers to this document must declare a version for each public release using three numbers separated by dots, called respectively [i]major[/i], [i]minor[/i] and [i]patch[/i] versions.
&#8203;
[*] The mod can be safely updated mid-game to a newer release which has the same [i]major[/i] version: the mod author expresses the intention to keep the new release compatible with a game save created using a previous release of the mod having the same [i]major[/i] version.
&#8203;
[*] A change in the [i]major[/i] version means compatibility with a previous version is not guaranteed: a game save created using a previous release of the mod will not work as expected with the newer version; a new game is required to use the newer version.
&#8203;
[*] A change in the [i]minor[/i] version means new features are added in a compatible fashion: it's safe to update mid-game.
&#8203;
[*] A change in the [i]patch[/i] version means only bugs are fixed, no new feature is added and compatibility is preserved: it's safe to update mid-game.
&#8203;
[*] Downgrading is not supported, unless specifically stated by the mod author.[/list]

[quote][b][color=#fce100]⚠️[/color][/b] [b][i]Warning[/i][/b]
A mod coming with a versioning scheme which looks like semantic versioning is to be assumed [b][i]NOT[/i][/b] to follow any specification, unless it explicitly refers to this document.[/quote]

[b]Examples[/b]

You can safely update mid-game in these cases:

[list]
[*][color=#16c60c]✔️[/color] 1.2.9 → 1.2.10;
[*][color=#16c60c]✔️[/color] 1.2.9 → 1.3.0.[/list]

You shouldn't update mid-game in the following cases, things will break and your game won't work as expected, start a new game instead:

[list]
[*][color=#f03a17]❌[/color] 1.2.9 → 2.3.0;
[*][color=#f03a17]❌[/color] 1.2.9 → 1.2.8.[/list]


[b]What is semantic versioning?[/b]

[url=https://semver.org/]Semantic versioning[/url] is a convention used in the software development industry and is designed to make it easier to tell whether upgrading a piece of software will keep or break the compatibility with other software.

It revolves around the definition of an [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface]application programming interface[/url] (API), which can be thought as a set of rules given by the software author to describe how other pieces of software can interact with it.


[b]What is the API of a game mod?[/b]

A mod can be designed as a library, a modders resource which defines a traditional API for other mods to interact with.

In most cases, however, a generic mod meant for direct use by the players doesn't need to define any API.

When a documented API is missing, the mod version can be linked to game save compatibility to tell if updating is supported.


[b]Can things break?[/b]

Despite of the author's intention, things break all the time: a release meant only to fix a bug, may not preserve compatibility as intended.

As a good measure, always keep a backup of your save files before any update.

If you notice any unexpected behavior after updating, test again using the original version you saved the game with.

In case the issue appears only with the newer version, inform the author in a polite way and following their instructions to file a bug report.
